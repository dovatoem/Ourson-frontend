# Ourson-frontend
This is the frontend of our bootcamp final project. 
It is a React Native mobile app optimized for iOS.
Ourson is a recipe app facilitating parents life by proposing recipes for the whole week (lunch and dinner) for the whole family.
Recipe for adult and baby have common ingredients which reduces preparation and cooking time. 
The app helps following what fruits and veggies baby has tasted. 
It gives the list of ingredients necessary to cook all the meals for the week.
